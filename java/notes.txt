1.Declare Array
int[] a;
2)initialize array:
int[] a =new int[]{1,2,3}
3)modify 
a[1] =10;
4)iterating over arays
for(iny i=0;i<numes.length;i++)
{
int values=numbers[i];
}
for(int value:number)
{

}
predefine method for arrays:
1.Arrays.toString(array):
converts an array to a string representation.
int[] number={1,2,3,4,5};
string arrayString=Arrays.toString(numbers);
2.Arrays sort(array):Sorts an array in ascending order
3.Arrays.copyOf(array,length):copies an  array to a new array with the specified length.
String strArray[]={"pyton"}

Constructers:


example:

    Create a class called 'bankAccount' that represents 
    a bank account . the 'BankAccount class should have
    instance variables suchas 'accountNumber','accoutnHolderName','balance' , etc.
    write a constructor for the 'BankAccount' clss that takes these parameters and 
    initailizes the insance variables.
    use the BankAccount class to create bank accoutn
    objects an simulate banking operations like diposite, withdraw, nad balance inquiry.

getter and stter methods
-------------------------


in java, Getter and Setter methods reused to retrive and update the pivate
variables. when you hide the implementation of the object of the class from
the outer world, you Declare them as private.
As private member of the class are not accessible from outside the class , so we can use the 
getter and setter method to retrive and update the values of private members.



 ArrayList class is a part of pf collection frame

 you are tasked with implementing a contact management system using as singly 
 linkedlist. The contact management system allows users to store and mange their 
 contacts and displsying all contacts . 
 Requirements: 1. implement a class called contact with the following properties .
 * 'name' : a string representing the phone number of the contact.
 * 'email' : a string representing the emil address of the  contact.


 2. implemnet a class called "contactlist" that manages the contact list using a singly liked list
 the "contactlist" class should have the following methods:

 "*addContact(Contact contact):
 Adds a new contact to the contact list .

 *searchContact(String name):

 searches for a contact by name and return the contact information if found.
 *displayContact()  : Displays all the contacts in the contact list.
